# Project Overview

In this project, I was presented with two JavaScript code examples, each demonstrating a different programming paradigm: imperative and declarative.I have analysed these examples and have determined that they both follow an imperative programming style however example two contains characteristics of a declarative programming style. I have presented my reasoning for each example in a loom video-linked above. At the end of the video, i state what i have learned from analysing the code snippets provided.
